📊 Instagram Analytics - SQL Data Cleaning, Modeling & Insights

An end-to-end SQL analytics project based on Instagram performance data.
The goal was to clean, structure, and analyze real post-level metrics to extract actionable insights for content strategy and audience behavior.

A Power BI dashboard was originally planned, but the SQL stage delivered complete analytical insights - therefore, the BI visualization phase is optional, not required.

🔍 Project Overview

This project covers the full analytical workflow:

✔️ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Cleaning inconsistent values

Standardizing media types & categories

Processing date fields (year, month, weekday)

Fixing numeric columns and formatting

Normalizing column names

Creating analysis ready tables

✔️ SQL Data Modeling

Structured tables for posts & performance metrics

Creating analytical fields:

Engagement Rate

Deep Interactions (saves + shares)

CTR

Interaction Efficiency

Preparing date dimensions for exploration

✔️ SQL Exploratory Analysis

Including insights on:

Best-performing categories

Best media types

Follower growth drivers

High-engagement weekdays

Month-by-month trends

Hashtag performance

Content efficiency

Traffic source breakdowns

Deep interaction analysis

Comparing formats (photo, video, reels, carousel)

✔️ Insight Generation

All insights come directly from SQL queries (included in the repository).

🗂 Dataset Details

The dataset includes:

Media types

Content categories

Likes, comments, shares, saves

Impressions & reach

Followers gained

Hashtag count

Engagement Rate

Traffic sources

Upload date (year, month, weekday)

📈 Key Insights from SQL

Fitness leads deep engagement with 30.63M saves + shares.

Video posts deliver the highest ER: 14.62%.

Beauty category shows the strongest engagement: 15.66%.

Music content brings the highest follower growth (1.54M).

Photo + Technology posts have the top efficiency score (0.1251).

Wednesday yields the highest engagement rate (15.11%).

Posts with 0 hashtags outperform all others with 18.61% ER.

Comedy posts get the highest impressions (1.28M).

Lifestyle posts receive the most comments on average.

Home Feed is the top source of new followers (2.54M).

March has the highest average ER (15.52%).

Every insight is backed by SQL code in the repository.

🚀 Current Project Status

✔ SQL data cleaning - completed

✔ SQL modeling - completed

✔ SQL exploration & insights - completed

⚪ Power BI dashboard - optional (not required)

The SQL layer already provides a comprehensive understanding of performance patterns, so a dashboard is not necessary to complete the analytical objectives of this project.

🧩 Tech Stack

SQL (main analysis)

Power Query (optional preprocessing)

Power BI (optional future enhancement)

📘 Summary

This project demonstrates a complete SQL-driven analytics workflow.
All meaningful insights were extracted through SQL logic and do not require additional BI visualization. The dashboard stage is optional and may be added later as an enhancement, but the analytical portion of the project is fully finished.
